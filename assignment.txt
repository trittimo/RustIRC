Our project will be a minimally functional IRC client and server. We will break down the assignment of points as follows:

CLIENT:
	1. [5 points] Connect to a server (for testing purposes, just display the message of the day)
	2. [15 points] Send heartbeats to the server to ensure the client is not kicked, and disconnect if there is no heartbeat response
	3. [15 points] Send messages to the server
	4. [15 points] Receive messages from the server

SERVER:
	1. [5 points] Receive connections from a client, and send them the motd
	2. [15 points] Receive heartbeats from the client, and disconnect them if a heartbeat is not received within a certain interval
	3. [15 points] Receive messages from the client
	4. [15 points] Forward messages to everyone

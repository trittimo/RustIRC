Our project will be a minimally functional IRC server. We will break down the assignment of points as follows:

1. [5 points] Receive connections from a client, and send them the motd
2. [20 points] Receive heartbeats from the client, and disconnect them if a heartbeat is not received within a certain interval
3. [20 points] Receive messages from the client
4. [20 points] Forward messages to everyone
5. [20 points] Support for multiple channels
6. [15 points] Support for whisper messages
